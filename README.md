# Heart-Disease-Detection
Detect risk of heart disease using machine learning model 

This project is a **Flask-based web application** that predicts the risk of heart disease based on patient input data such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators. The prediction is made using a **machine learning model** trained on medical data.  

## **Features**  
- User-friendly web interface for inputting patient details  
- Machine learning-based heart disease prediction  
- Health tips based on the prediction results  
- Secure login/logout functionality  
- Responsive design with background images  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS  
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Decision Tree)  
- **Database**: SQLite (for user authentication)  

## **Setup Instructions**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-detection.git
   cd heart-disease-detection
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the Flask application:  
   ```bash
